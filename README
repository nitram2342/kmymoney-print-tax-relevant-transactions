This is a helper script for generating a list of transactions for the tax
declaration.

Background
-----------

Each year, I bring a list of invoices and all kinds of supporting documents to
my tax accountant. To not forget anything important, I make my book keeping with
KMyMoney, where I import bank transactions via FinTS (formerly HBCI) and via
manual edits (for things I payed in cash and which are tax relevant). All
transactions are categorized.

I pre-sort all documents according to the categories. Each category (or a
set of sub-categories) is seperated with a seperator sheet. This is a
landscape-oriented sheet.


This tool
----------

This helper script extracts all transactions from a KMyMoney file for a certain
year and reports them in a PDF file. In addition, this PDF file contains the
seperator sheets, that are folded at a marker line.
